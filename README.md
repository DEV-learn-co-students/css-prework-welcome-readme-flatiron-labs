# Welcome to the Flatiron School!

In this track you're going to find a ton of material that you will need to complete before arriving at Flatiron for the Summer Bootcamp. 

Each resource has an estimated amount of time it should take you if you have zero prior knowledge on the topic. We make suggestions of how much time to spend on each section. Try and achieve the learning objectives in the suggested time frame, then move on. You can always come back and watch the section again.

Some of the resources have quizzes/badges attached. If you're already familiar with a topic, feel free to pass the quiz and move-on. That being said, we even find ourselves learning new things from the material. 

These paths are designed around breadth over depth. It's important to get a solid foundation in the broad set of fundamentals within each path before diving deeper into a specific area. Try to read and watch as much as possible.

Be sure to go through this material sequentially!

Learning should have context, and you should know what your goals are. Each section will address which learning objectives it will cover. There's an infinite amount of things you could spend your time learning, part of the value of this prework is that we can narrow the scope to only the most essential. If you can achieve fluency in the following topics we believe you'll flourish at the Flatiron School.

## Thoughts

One of the challenges in learning how to code and teach code is that you probably don't even know what you're supposed to learn. When creating this prework, we had 4 goals in mind.

1. **Full Stack**: We'll present the full stack of technologies required to build a webapp from the ground up. It doesn't matter if you use ERB or HAML. The web is built on HTML and everyone should learn it. Whether NoSQL or RDBMS, understanding the fundamentals of schema design and SQL is crucial. Students shouldn't shy away from depth. How can you be a web developer without a proficiency in these skills?

2. **Linear Progression**: The material is presented in order, going from web basics and computer basics, to markup, to styling, to version control, to programming, and then to databases and web frameworks. You learn the basics of code through Ruby and then finally move to Rails that builds upon the rest. Thus you start at the lowest level, the literal HTML the browser renders, and progress up through levels of abstraction until you finally get to the kitchen sink that is the Rails framework. As a beginner, don't try to learn Rails without knowing basic HTML/CSS and ruby. It's a disservice to your education.

3. **Curated Resources**: There is such a plethora of amazing content on learning to code. We liked the consistency of going to a few sources that all shared common interfaces and learning patterns, like videos and interactive portions. So this isn't a complete list of all the resources, but more a curated list of what we think works well together (with lots of feedback from alumni). We would love it if you submitted a github issue with more materials you've enjoyed.

4. **Language Agnosticism**: In the end, programming is about abstractions and expressions. The mechanics of code are universal and exist in all modern languages, like python, ruby, and javascript. We teach Ruby because we love it. Thinking your language choice, especially as a beginner, matters, is like thinking that you can only write poetry in English and not in Spanish. Obviously the beauty of poetry is in rhyme and meter, in metaphor and simile, in cadence and rhythm, not in the king's English. Why should code be any different? At Flatiron, you're learning how to think, how to break problems down, how to express yourself, how to abstract ideas, and how to work together. We just learn that through Ruby.

## Learning Objectives

The goal of this prework is to be able to do the following:

  1. Be comfortable navigating your development environment
  2. Understand where programming skills fit into the "web"
  3. Understand what pieces make up a web application
  4. Develop a level of comfort with the most common ruby patterns in web development
  5. Understand the basics of version control and why it is used
  6. Have a basic understanding of HTML including forms
  7. Develop a comfort with basic SQL queries

## Deliverables

Apart from the quizzes and assignments in the track, there will be two additional delivarables before the start of the program:
  1. A personal web page, built using HTML and CSS (and JavaScript, if you want to get fancy!)
  2. A larger Ruby-based command line application, preferably using object-oriented programming (OOP).
