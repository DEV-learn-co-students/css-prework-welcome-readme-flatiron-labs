We're so excited that you'll be learning to code with us, and will be the lead faciliators at your CSSI locations this summer. The purpose of this training is to give you a solid understanding of the tools and technologies that your students will be learning this summer at CSSI. We don't expect you to become experienced developers with 60 hours of pre-work, but the content here should be enought to get you conversant in the concepts and frameworks that are introduced to students learning to code for the first time.

Each resource has an estimated amount of time it should take you if you have zero prior knowledge on the topic. We make suggestions of how much time to spend on each section. Try and achieve the learning objectives in the suggested time frame, then move on. You can always come back and watch the section again.

If you are already familiar with a topic, feel free to skip it and come back. The prework is designed around breadth over depth. It's important to get a solid foundation in the broad set of fundamentals before diving deeper into a specific area. Try to read and watch as much as possible.

Learning should have context, and you should know what your goals are. Each section will address which learning objectives it will cover. There's an infinite amount of things you could spend your time learning, part of the value of this prework is that we can narrow the scope to only the most essential. If you can achieve fluency in the topics here, you'll be fully prepared to facilitate the CSSI course.


## Learning Objectives

The goal of this prework is to be able to do the following:

  1. Be comfortable navigating your development environment.
  2. Understand where programming skills fit into the "web".
  3. Understand what pieces make up a web application.
  4. Use the key tools of front end development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
  5. Develop a level of comfort with the Python language as it is used in web development
  6. Understand the basics of version control and why it is used
  7. Get an overview of AppEngine and understand the MVC paradigm of app development


## What does it mean to be a CSSI Facilitator? What am I expected to do?

Facilitators are the glue that keeps a three-week CSSI session running smoothly. They build classroom culture, understand the overall arc of the course, and ensure that students are learning and feel supported as they move through the program. 

Faciliators will:

+ Understand the CSSI curriculum and course arc.
+ Support lead and module instructors in ensuring student understanding of CSSI curriculum.
+ Spot gaps in lead instructor and module instructor lessons and modify instructional plan accordingly
+ Prepare module instructors for their teaching responsibilities through coaching sessions.
+ Provide strong teaching feedback to lead instructors and module instructors.
+ Develop a classroom culture of supported risk-taking.
+ Lead ice-breakers and facilitate the development of group cohesion.
+ Develop daily plans and coordinate lead and module instructor teaching responsibilities.

As a facilitator you will not be expected to teach classes or debug student code, but the better you understand the content, the more you'll be able to support students and teachers.
